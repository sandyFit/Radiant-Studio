        "question": "How Often Should I Go to the Dentist?",
        "answer": ["You should go to the dentist at least twice a year (every 6 months). Here's why: most lesions (decay or soft tissue) can be easily treated if caught quickly.", 
                    "But everyone is unique, so we tailor our recall visits to your oral health needs. Things like stress and illness can affect your oral health, making it more important to see your dentist. It's best to talk to your dentist about your individual needs."]

        "question": "When Should My Child First Visit the Dentist?",
        "answer": ["The sooner children get used to going to the dentist office, the better.", 
                    "If a child has teeth, and will at least sit in the chair and allow either the dentist or dental hygienist to look in their mouth, it's time for a visit.", 
                    "For some children it's as early as 3, and we will check on the development of the teeth and size of the jaw.",
                    "Our family-friendly dentistry office can talk to you about oral hygiene techniques and ways to avoid cavities."]

        "question": "What Should I Do If I Have Bad Breath?",
        "answer": ["Bad breath is commonly caused by food debris, plaque buildup around teeth and gums, and/or periodontal disease with odor-producing bacteria. However, it can sometimes be a symptom of a systemic (body) disease.",
                    "Treatments for bad breath can include a thorough scaling and polishing of teeth surfaces, both above and below the gum line:", 
                    "Brushing the top of the tongue, improving oral hygiene through flossing, using a Water-Pik, electric tooth brushing and mouthwash. Avoidance of overly spicy foods can also help."]

    {
        "question": "What Can I Do About Missing Teeth?",
        "answer": ["Missing teeth can be replaced by “fixed” or “removable” restorations. Fixed restorations include bridges or implants, while removable restorations include partial or full denture.", 
                    "There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but fixed restorations are most like having your own teeth."]

    {
        "question": "How Do Dental Implants Work?",
        "answer": ["Implants are actually a two-stage procedure: they are surgically placed into the jawbone in the same way that the roots of our teeth reside, and then the implant is restored by either a crown, bridge, or denture.", 
                    "Most often, the placement of an implant is done by either an oral surgeon or periodontist, while the restoration is done by a general dentist."]
    },
    {
        "question": "How Do I Know if I Have Gum Disease?",
        "answer": ["Gum (periodontal) disease can be insidious in that it sneaks up on you without much pain or discomfort. The warning signs are bad breath, bleeding gums, and loose or sensitive teeth.", 
                    "If you find blood when rinsing after brushing or flossing, you may already have gum disease. Don't wait until you have a gum infection to come in for a checkup or cleaning visit", 
                    "Power brushes vary, but many studies show that in general, they are more efficient in controlling plaque than manual brushes."]
